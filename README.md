# Personal-AI-Assistant
This is the repository for the data obtained through the broken hard-drive of the Linux System of my Grade 9 (2017) where there were some project related to the simple AI using Tensorflow, Keras and other modules for CNN, simple Transformers, Classifiers, and so on.

As the Hard-drive was damaged the files were difficult to retreve from it but some files were able to retreve and will be added as soon as they are retreved.
