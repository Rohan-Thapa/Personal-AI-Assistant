# Personal-AI-Assistant
This is the repository for the data obtained through the broken hard-drive of the Linux System of my Grade 9 (2017) where there were some project related to the simple AI using Tensorflow, Keras and other modules for CNN, simple Transformers, Classifiers, and so on.

As the Hard-drive was damaged the files were difficult to retreve from it but some files were able to retreve and will be added as soon as they are retreved.

## Code Pictures
Along with the code of reading the news from the internet, there was also the retrive of the images shot on my Windows system for the test running how it works on the Windows system which is must widely used PC operating software.

The design on which the whole Assistant was functioning and how it could be enabled.
